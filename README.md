Hello! This was an enjoyable project ðŸ™‚. Here's some information about it:


## Installation
- Type `npm install` (or yarn if preferred) to install dependencies.

## To run the app
- Type `npm start` to run the application, and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- Enter a GitHub API key (e.g. a personal access token) into the input field to see your repositories
- Click on a listed repository to view its issues
- Click the up or down arrows on the left of each issue to reorder the issues

## To run tests
- Type `npm test` to run the Jest test suite.

<hr>

### TODO (in order of importance, descending)
- Achieve more test coverage (particularly of components)
- Replace non-semantic HTML tags with semantic ones
- Include JSDoc-style annotations to components / functions
- More thoroughly comment code
- Improve styling
- Improve "fuzzyTime" output (perhaps use a library if a small one exists)
